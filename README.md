## Credits

- Bailey, or the person who made the original Queer Client and is my inspiration for creating this
- Cyri [https://github.com/Fentanull] and the Yakuza bros for being cool
- Everyone in the ECME community thats been cool to me

## Usage

### General

- Download the jar under the 'releases' tab
- Put it into your mods folder along with the Fabric API file

### Building/Devs

- Clone this repository and extract it to your desired folder (if you are using vscode you'll be done at this point)
- navigate to the folder in command prompt and run ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
- run ./gradlew build if you want a jar, or if you just wanted the source you're done now
- the jar should be under the build\libs folder, choose the one without any suffixes

If you find any bugs feel free to open an issue or even make a pull request if you already know a fix
