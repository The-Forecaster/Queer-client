<h1 align="center"> Queer Client
<p> Minecraft Hack client/Utility Mod
  Don't take this too seriously
  
  
  ## Credits
  - Bailey, or the person who made the original Queer Client and is my inspiration for creating this
  - Travis, https://github.com/TrvsF, really cool dude who let me work on Wurst+3 with him and others, gave me a start into coding
  - Everyone I've met in anarchy
  
  ## Usage
  ### General usage
  - Download the jar under the 'releases' tab
  - Put it into your mods folder along with the Fabric API file
  
  ### Building/Devs
  - Clone this repository and extract it to your desired folder (if you're are using vscode you'll be done at this point)
  - navigate to the folder in command prompt and run ./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
  - run ./gradlew build if you want a jar, or if you just wanted the source you're done now
  - the jar should be under the build\libs folder, choose the one without any suffixes
